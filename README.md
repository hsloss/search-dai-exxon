# search-dai-exxon

This search tool fitlers project keywords by name and displays:

1) the keyword definition and;
2) a list of related keywords in a 'see also' list

**New keywords can be added dynamically via JSON file as needed.

**Search functionality is also setup to filter by keywords, by perhaps a Group ID rather than simply matching based on name, when related keywords do not share similar names. JSON file simply needs to be updated with a Group ID property.
